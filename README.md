Good tools make application development quicker and easier to maintain than if you did everything by hand.

The Angular CLI is a command line interface tool that can create a project, add files, and perform a variety of ongoing development tasks such as testing, bundling, and deployment.

The goal in this guide is to build and run a simple Angular application in TypeScript, using the Angular CLI while adhering to the Style Guide recommendations that benefit every Angular project.

By the end of the chapter, you'll have a basic understanding of development with the CLI and a foundation for both these documentation samples and for real world applications.

And you can also download the example.

 Step 1. Set up the Development Environment

You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.

Install Node.jsÂ® and npm if they are not already on your machine.

Verify that you are running at least node 6.9.x and npm 3.x.x by running node -v and npm -v in a terminal/console window. Older versions produce errors, but newer versions are fine.

Then install the Angular CLI globally.

 content_copy
npm install -g @angular/cli
 Step 2. Create a new project

Open a terminal window.

Generate a new project and skeleton application by running the following commands:

 content_copy
ng new my-app
Patience please. It takes time to set up a new project, most of it spent installing npm packages.

 Step 3: Serve the application

Go to the project directory and launch the server.

 content_copy
cd my-app
ng serve --open
The ng serve command launches the server, watches your files, and rebuilds the app as you make changes to those files.

Using the --open (or just -o) option will automatically open your browser on http://localhost:4200/.

Your app greets you with a message:

The app works!
 Step 4: Edit your first Angular component

The CLI created the first Angular component for you. This is the root component and it is named app-root. You can find it in ./src/app/app.component.ts.

Open the component file and change the title property from Welcome to app!! to Welcome to My First Angular App!!:

src/app/app.component.ts
 content_copy
export class AppComponent {
  title = 'My First Angular App';
}
The browser reloads automatically with the revised title. That's nice, but it could look better.

Open src/app/app.component.css and give the component some style.

src/app/app.component.css
 content_copy
h1 {
  color: #369;
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
  font-size: 250%;
}
 Output of QuickStart app
Looking good!
